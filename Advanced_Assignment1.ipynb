    "Ans):\n",
    "    We may create apps utilising an Object-Oriented methodology thanks to it. Classes and objects are simple to build and utilise in Python. Using classes and objects to design the programme is an object-oriented approach. The item is connected to actual things like a book, house, pencil, etc."

    "Ans):\n",
    "    An attribute is first searched for in the instance object, then in the class it derives from, and finally in all higher superclasses, progressing (by default) from left to right. When the attribute is located, the search ends there."

    "Ans):\n",
    "    Instance objects represent specific instances of the class, whereas class objects represent the class itself. While instance objects have their own set of attributes and methods that are independent of other instance objects, class objects can have class-level attributes and methods that are shared by all instances of the class."
