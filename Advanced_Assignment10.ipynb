    "    __getattr__ is invoked when an attribute is not found using the normal lookup process, while __getattribute__ is called every time an attribute is accessed, regardless of its existence. __getattr__ is used for handling attribute lookup failures, while __getattribute__ allows you to intercept and customize attribute access behavior."

    "    4.Properties provide a way to encapsulate attribute access logic and perform additional actions when getting, setting, or deleting attribute values.\n",

    "    3.Descriptors are assigned to class attributes, and their behavior is triggered when accessing these attributes.\n",
    "    4.They allow you to control attribute access at the class level, providing fine-grained control over how attributes are retrieved, assigned, and deleted.\n",
    "    5.Descriptors can be shared among multiple instances of a class and provide a way to define attribute behavior that is independent of individual instances.\n",
    "    6.They can be used to implement shared data attributes, custom data access patterns, or complex attribute management."
