    "Ans):\n",
    "    A metaclass in Python is a class of a class that defines how a class behaves. A class is itself an instance of a metaclass. A class in Python defines how the instance of the class will behave. In order to understand metaclasses well, one needs to have prior experience working with Python classes."

    "Q3. How do class decorators overlap with metaclasses for handling classes?\n",
    "Ans):\n",
    "    Both class decorators and metaclasses allow us to customize the behavior of classes in Python. While class decorators can modify or add functionality to a class after it has been defined, metaclasses allow us to customize the creation of the class itself. Although class decorators can be used as an alternative to metaclasses in some cases, metaclasses provide more powerful customization options than class decorators, but they can also be more complex to use."

    "Ans):\n",
    "    Both class decorators and metaclasses can be used to customize the behavior of instances of a class. Class decorators modify the behavior of all instances of the class, while metaclasses are used to customize the creation of instances of a class. Class decorators are simpler to use, while metaclasses provide more powerful customization options and can be used to implement more complex behaviors."
