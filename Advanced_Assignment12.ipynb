    "Ans):\n",
    "    Yes, assigning a value to a string's indexed character violates Python's string immutability. Strings are immutable in Python, which means that once a string is created, it cannot be modified. If you try to modify a string by assigning a value to one of its indexed characters, you will get a TypeError.\n"

    "Ans):\n",
    "    Using the += operator to concatenate strings does not violate Python's string immutability. The += operator creates a new string object that is the concatenation of the original string and the new string. The original string is not modified, but rather a new string is created with the concatenated value. Therefore, the original string remains immutable, and a new string object is created with the concatenated value."

    "    In Python, there is only one way to index a character in a string, and that is by using square brackets [] with the index of the character you want to access. For example, if you have a string s and you want to access the first character, you can use s[0]. If you want to access the second character, you can use s[1], and so on."

It is also more concise and easier to read than using the index() method with a try-except block to catch the exception."
