    "Ans):\n",
    "    Regular expressions are useful in search and replace operations. The typical use case is to look for a sub-string that matches a pattern and replace it with something else. Most APIs using regular expressions allow you to reference capture groups from the search pattern in the replacement string."

    "    In regular expressions, square brackets are used to define a character class, which matches any one of the characters inside the brackets. When used to express a range, the characters inside the brackets represent a range of characters. For example, [a-z] matches any lowercase letter from a to z."

    "Ans):\n",
    "    Compiling a regular-expression object can benefit you by improving the performance of your code. When you compile a regular-expression object, the pattern is preprocessed and optimized, which can result in faster execution times when the pattern is used repeatedly in your code."

    "Ans):\n",
    "    The match object returned by re.match and re.search can be used to obtain information about the search performed. For example, you can use the group() method to obtain the matched string, and the start() and end() methods to obtain the indices of the start and end of the match."
