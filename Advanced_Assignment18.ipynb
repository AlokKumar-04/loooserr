    "Q1. Describe the differences between text and binary files in a single paragraph.\n",
    "Ans):\n",
    "    Text files and binary files differ in their representation of data. Text files store information as a sequence of characters encoded in a human-readable format, typically using ASCII or Unicode encoding. They contain plain text, including letters, numbers, and symbols. On the other hand, binary files store data in a format that is not directly readable by humans. They consist of binary digits (0s and 1s) and can represent various types of information, such as images, audio, video, or executable programs. Unlike text files, binary files require specific software or applications to interpret and manipulate the data they contain."

    "Ans):\n",
    "    Text files are preferred when human readability and easy editing are important, such as in configuration files, log files, and code files. Binary files are advantageous when efficiency, performance, and data integrity are critical, such as in large data storage, data serialization, and encryption."

    "Ans):\n",
    "    Using binary operations to read and write Python integers directly to disk can have issues related to endianness, platform dependence, data corruption, and lack of readability. To ensure data integrity and portability, it is advisable to use higher-level data serialization formats like JSON or pickle, which offer structured and standardized approaches for storing data."

    "Ans):\n",
    "    Using the with keyword instead of explicitly opening a file provides the benefit of automatic resource management. When you use the with statement in Python to open a file, it ensures that the file is properly closed when you are done with it, even if an exception or error occurs during the process. This helps prevent resource leaks and ensures that the file is closed in a timely and efficient manner."

    "Ans):\n",
    "    Pickling is the best option when you need to serialize and store Python objects in a format that can be easily saved to disk or transmitted over a network. Pickling allows you to convert complex data structures, such as lists, dictionaries, and custom objects, into a binary representation that can be stored or transmitted efficiently. It is commonly used for tasks such as caching, session management, inter-process communication, and data persistence. However, it's important to note that pickling is specific to Python and may not be suitable if you need to exchange data with other programming languages."
