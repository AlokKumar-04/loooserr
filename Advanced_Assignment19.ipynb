    "Q1. Define the relationship between a class and its instances. Is it a one-to-one or a one-to-many\n",
    "partnership, for example?\n",
    "Ans):\n",
    "    In Python, the relationship between a class and its instances can be described as a one-to-many partnership. A class serves as a blueprint or template for creating multiple instances, also known as objects. Each instance represents a unique entity with its own set of attributes and behaviors defined by the class. While a class provides the structure and behavior common to all instances, each instance can have its own distinct state and can be manipulated independently. Therefore, for a given class, there can be multiple instances created, forming a one-to-many relationship.\n"

It is a piece of code that defines the behavior of an object or performs an action within the context of that object.
