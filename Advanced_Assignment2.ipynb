    "Ans):\n",
    "    In this example, we create an instance of the MyClass class and call its my_method method. When we call my_method, we don't need to pass in any arguments for the self parameter - Python automatically passes in the instance of the class that the method is being called on. In this case, my_object is the instance of the MyClass class that my_method is being called on.\n",

    "Ans):\n",
    "    The operator overloading in Python means provide extended meaning beyond their predefined operational meaning. Such as, we use the \"+\" operator for adding two integers as well as joining two strings or merging two lists. We can achieve this as the \"+\" operator is overloaded by the \"int\" class and \"str\" class."

    "Ans):\n",
    "    Operator Overloading means giving extended meaning beyond their predefined operational meaning. For example operator + is used to add two integers as well as join two strings and merge two lists. It is achievable because ‘+’ operator is overloaded by int class and str class. You might have noticed that the same built-in operator or function shows different behavior for objects of different classes, this is called Operator Overloading. "

    "Ans):\n",
    "    In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming. The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data."
