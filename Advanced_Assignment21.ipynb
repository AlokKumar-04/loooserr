    "predict them at all?\n",
    "Ans):\n",
    "    A probability distribution is a mathematical function that describes the likelihood of different outcomes in a random event. While individual values are unpredictable, probability distributions allow us to make predictions about the overall pattern or behavior of the random variable. By analyzing distribution properties, we can understand the probabilities associated with different outcomes and make informed predictions about the random process."

    "Ans):\n",
    "    True random numbers are generated from inherently unpredictable sources, while pseudo-random numbers are generated using deterministic algorithms. Pseudo-random numbers are considered \"good enough\" for many applications due to their efficiency, reproducibility, and statistical properties that closely resemble true random numbers. While pseudo-random numbers are not truly random, they are suitable for various practical purposes where high unpredictability is not essential. However, in contexts requiring high levels of unpredictability, true random numbers may be preferred."

    "Q3. What are the two main factors that influence the behaviour of a 'normal' probability distribution?\n",
    "Ans):\n",
    "    The behavior of a 'normal' probability distribution is primarily influenced by two factors: the mean, which determines the central tendency of the distribution, and the standard deviation, which measures the spread or dispersion of the data around the mean. The mean determines the peak or center of the distribution, while the standard deviation determines the width or concentration of values. Together, these factors define the shape and characteristics of a normal distribution."

    "Q4. Provide a real-life example of a normal distribution.\n",
    "Ans):\n",
    "    One real-life example of a normal distribution is the distribution of human heights. In a large population, heights tend to follow a normal distribution pattern. The majority of people fall around the average height, which is the mean of the distribution. Taller and shorter individuals occur less frequently as you move away from the mean. The standard deviation of the distribution represents the typical amount of variation in heights. This normal distribution of heights can be observed in various populations, such as a sample of students in a school or a dataset of heights collected from a national survey."

    "happen as the number of trials grows?\n",
    "Ans):\n",
    "    In the short term, a probability distribution may exhibit variability and may not accurately reflect the underlying probabilities due to sampling variability. However, as the number of trials or observations increases, the observed distribution tends to converge towards the true probability distribution. This convergence is described by the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem. With more trials, the observed distribution becomes more reliable, approaching the expected probabilities and allowing for more accurate predictions and inferences about the random process."

    "Q6. What kind of object can be shuffled by using random.shuffle?\n",
    "Ans):\n",
    "    The random.shuffle function can be used to shuffle the elements of a mutable sequence, such as a list. It modifies the sequence in-place, rearranging its elements randomly to create a new order. Other mutable sequences, such as arrays or byte arrays, can also be shuffled using random.shuffle. However, immutable sequences, such as strings or tuples, cannot be shuffled directly since they cannot be modified. To shuffle an immutable sequence, you would need to convert it to a mutable sequence, shuffle it, and then convert it back if needed."

    "    Exponentiation and logarithms have an inverse relationship. Exponentiation involves raising a base to a given exponent, while logarithms determine the exponent needed to obtain a specific value with a given base. Exponentiation and logarithms are complementary operations, where logarithms help find the exponent in an exponentiation operation, and exponentiation helps find the value corresponding to a given exponent in a logarithmic operation. This inverse relationship is essential for solving equations, modeling exponential growth and decay, and performing calculations involving exponents and logarithms."
