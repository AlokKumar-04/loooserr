    "Q1. Which two operator overloading methods can you use in your classes to support iteration?\n",
    "Ans):\n",
    "    To support iteration in classes, you can use the __iter__ and __next__ methods. The __iter__ method should return an iterator object, and the __next__ method defines the behavior of retrieving the next item in the iteration. By implementing these methods, We enable iteration over instances of your class using for loops or by calling the next() function."

    "Q2. In what contexts do the two operator overloading methods manage printing?\n",
    "Ans):\n",
    "    The __str__ method is used for producing human-readable output when an object is converted to a string or printed, while the __repr__ method is used for providing a detailed and unambiguous representation of an object, often for debugging purposes."

    "Ans):\n",
    "    To intercept slice operations in a class, we can define the __getitem__ method with support for the slice object. The __getitem__ method allows you to customize the behavior when accessing elements of an object using indexing or slicing."

    "Ans):\n",
    "    To capture in-place addition in a class, we can define the __iadd__ method. The __iadd__ method allows you to customize the behavior when the += operator is used to perform in-place addition on an object."

    "Ans):\n",
    "    Operator overloading is mostly useful when you're making a new class that falls into an existing \"Abstract Base Class\" (ABC)  indeed, many of the ABCs in standard library module collections rely on the presence of certain special methods. "
