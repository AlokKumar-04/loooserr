    "Q1. What are the two latest user-defined exception constraints in Python 3.X?\n",
    "Ans):\n",
    "    Python 3.X does not have a fixed set of user-defined exception constraints. Users can create custom exceptions in Python by defining new classes that inherit from the built-in Exception class or any of its subclasses. The constraints or conditions for user-defined exceptions are not predefined by the language itself but can be defined by the programmer based on their specific needs or requirements. Therefore, there is no specific information on the \"two latest\" user-defined exception constraints in Python 3.X, as it depends on the individual developers and their applications."

    "Q3. Describe two methods for attaching context information to exception artefacts.\n",
    "Ans):\n",
    "    Method 1: Exception Annotations\n",
    "One method for attaching context information to exception artifacts is through exception annotations. This involves adding additional metadata or properties to the exception object itself. These annotations can include relevant information such as error codes, timestamps, user or session identifiers, or any other contextual details that might help in understanding the cause and context of the exception. By attaching this information directly to the exception object, it becomes readily accessible when handling and logging the exception, enabling better understanding and analysis of the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Method 2: Logging and Error Reporting\n",
    "Another method is to leverage logging and error reporting mechanisms to attach context information to exception artifacts. When an exception occurs, relevant contextual details can be logged along with the exception stack trace. This can include information such as the current state of the application, input parameters, configuration settings, or any other relevant data. By including this context in the log or error report, it becomes easier to diagnose and troubleshoot the exception later on. Additionally, tools or frameworks can be utilized to aggregate and analyze these logs, providing insights into the patterns and causes of exceptions, aiding in identifying and resolving underlying issues."

    "Q4. Describe two methods for specifying the text of an exception objects error message.\n",
    "Ans):\n",
    "    Method 1: Constructor Parameter\n",
    "One method for specifying the text of an exception object's error message is by providing it as a parameter to the constructor of the exception class. This approach allows the caller to pass a custom error message when creating an instance of the exception. For example, in many programming languages, the constructor of an exception class may have a parameter specifically designed for the error message. By passing the desired error message as an argument to the constructor, the exception object is created with the specified error message, making it more informative and relevant to the specific context in which it is thrown.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Method 2: Property or Setter Method\n",
    "Another method for specifying the text of an exception object's error message is by setting it through a property or a setter method provided by the exception class. In this approach, the exception object is created with a default error message, and then the error message can be modified or customized using a property or a dedicated method. This allows for greater flexibility, as the error message can be updated or adjusted at different stages of the program flow, depending on the information available or the specific conditions encountered. This method enables developers to provide more dynamic and contextual error messages for better troubleshooting and debugging."
