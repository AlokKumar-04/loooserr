    "Ans):\n",
    "    In Python 3.x, there are regular strings and raw strings. Regular strings support operations like concatenation, repetition, indexing, slicing, and methods for manipulation. Raw strings are used when backslashes need to be treated as literal characters. They are useful for file paths, regular expressions, and similar cases. Regular strings are enclosed in quotes, while raw strings start with the 'r' character."

    "Ans):\n",
    "    In Python 3.x, text mode and binary mode are two file handling modes with key differences. Text mode handles files using character encoding, performs line ending translation, and allows for automatic decoding and encoding of text data. Binary mode treats files as a sequence of bytes without automatic encoding/decoding or line ending translation. Binary mode is suitable for byte-oriented operations and working with non-text files. Text mode raises exceptions for encoding errors, while binary mode does not handle them automatically. The mode can be specified when opening a file using the 't' or 'b' argument, with text mode being the default."

    "    To interpret a Unicode text file encoded in a different encoding than your platform's default, specify the desired encoding when opening the file using the encoding parameter in the open() function. This ensures that the text is correctly decoded and interpreted. Be sure to know the correct encoding beforehand, as incorrect encoding may lead to incorrect interpretation of the text."

    "    1. Open the file using the open() function and specify the file name, mode, and encoding.\n",

    "Q7. What qualifies ASCII text as a form of Unicode text?\n",
    "Ans):\n",
    "    ASCII text is considered a form of Unicode text because the first 128 characters of Unicode directly correspond to the ASCII characters. Unicode expands on ASCII by including additional characters to support a wider range of languages and symbols. ASCII text can be represented using Unicode code points, and thus, ASCII can be treated as a subset of the Unicode character set."

    "Ans):\n",
    "    The change in string types from ASCII to Unicode in Python 3.x has a significant impact on code. It introduces better Unicode support, requires explicit encoding and decoding operations, and may require modifications to ensure compatibility with Python 3.x. The print statement syntax changes, and there may be differences in string handling among libraries and modules. While there can be slight performance differences, overall, the shift to Unicode brings long-term benefits and aligns with modern practices."
