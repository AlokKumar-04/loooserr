    "1. What advantages do Excel spreadsheets have over CSV spreadsheets?\n",
    "Ans):\n",
    "    a) Excel spreadsheets have more formatting options: With Excel, you can change the font, color, and style of your data, as well as add charts and tables. \n",
    "    b) Excel spreadsheets can handle more complex data: While CSV files are great for simple lists, Excel can handle more complex data, such as formulas and functions, which can help automate calculations.\n",
    "    c) Excel spreadsheets are easier to manipulate: With Excel, you can easily sort, filter, and search for data. You can also insert and delete rows and columns, which can be helpful when working with large datasets.\n",
    "    d) Excel is more widely used: Excel is one of the most widely used spreadsheet programs in the world, so it's more likely that people will be familiar with it than with CSV files. This can be an advantage when sharing data with others."
