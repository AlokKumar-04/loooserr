    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "     Function is a piece of code which makes the code readable,reusable and divides the code into several different modules. Instead of performing tedius operations again and again,we can write a single function code and reuse it according to our own convenience by calling the function and passing the arguments."

    "5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    Local (or function) scope is the code block or body of any Python function or lambda expression. This Python scope contains the names that you define inside the function. These names will only be visible from the code of the function. It’s created at function call, not at function definition, so you’ll have as many different local scopes as function calls. This is true even if you call the same function multiple times, or recursively. Each call will result in a new local scope being created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enclosing (or nonlocal) scope is a special scope that only exists for nested functions. If the local scope is an inner or nested function, then the enclosing scope is the scope of the outer or enclosing function. This scope contains the names that you define in the enclosing function. The names in the enclosing scope are visible from the code of the inner and enclosing functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Global (or module) scope is the top-most scope in a Python program, script, or module. This Python scope contains all of the names that you define at the top level of a program or a module. Names in this Python scope are visible from everywhere in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Built-in scope is a special Python scope that’s created or loaded whenever you run a script or open an interactive session. This scope contains names such as keywords, functions, exceptions, and other attributes that are built into Python. Names in this Python scope are also available from everywhere in your code. It’s automatically loaded by Python when you run a program or script.\n",

    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    When a function is called by passing exactly same number of arguments as defined in function\"s signature,the value of arguments is passed on to local variables in the function(local variables get initialized) and are recognised by compiler inside the body of the function only till it gets executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a function call is returned(ex- if the function arguments are less/more than those specified in function signature),the local variables dont get any value passed/assigned on to them and hence since the body of the function is not executed,they are not recognised. When a function returns, the local scope is destroyed, and all the variables in it are forgotten."
