Ex- if we point to a subdirectory inside the present working directory we will use command os.chdir(os.getcwd()+\"\\:directoryname\").The latter string\"\\:directoryname\" is referred to as relative path wrt present working directory."

    "Ans8)- read()- reads entire text in a file in one go. readline()-reads entire text in a file until it encounters escape character(\"\\n\"). The read() method returns the file’s entire contents as a single string value. The readlines() method returns a list of strings, where each string is a line from the file’s contents."
